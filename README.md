# Implementation Master Thesis Bavo Andriessen

This repository contains the source code of my master thesis. 

The directory ```framework``` contains the implementation of the proposed framework, along with manuals for how to create, configure and deploy this framework. 

The directory ```evaluation``` contains the evaluation data, a Jupyter notebook in which the results were obtained and the Kubernetes manifests used to deploy the testsetups. 

The README.md files in the subdirectories provide instructions on how to deploy, configure and build Deucalion apps and an explanation on how the evaluation was performed.
